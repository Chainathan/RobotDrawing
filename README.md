📄 **[Project Report](./Report.pdf)**

This project implements an autonomous robotic sketching system that converts a portrait image into drawable geometric trajectories and executes the drawing using a 6-DOF Trossen WidowX 250s robotic arm. The core objective is to retain key facial features from the input image in the resulting sketch.
