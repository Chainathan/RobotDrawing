Image Preprocessin:
Connect nearby disconnected components

Graph:
Curvature-Based Resampling (Adaptive Sampling)
    Place more points in curved sections and fewer in straight segments.

Resampling:
Try RDP


Path Optimization: 
    Consider each branch point and terminal point as nodes and generate optimal movement between different components
